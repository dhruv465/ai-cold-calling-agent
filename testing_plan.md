# System Testing and Validation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing and validation approach for the AI Cold Calling Agent with CRM Dashboard. The testing process will ensure all components function correctly, integrations work seamlessly, and the system complies with Indian telecommunications regulations.

## Test Environments
- **Development**: Local environment for unit and integration testing
- **Staging**: AWS environment mirroring production for system and acceptance testing
- **Production**: Final deployment environment

## Testing Phases

### 1. Unit Testing
- **Backend Services**: Test individual controllers, services, and utilities
- **Frontend Components**: Test React components and state management
- **AI Engine**: Test script generation, response analysis, and objection handling
- **Security**: Test encryption, authentication, and authorization

### 2. Integration Testing
- **Database Integration**: Test ORM models and database operations
- **Twilio Integration**: Test outbound calling, TTS, STT, and webhooks
- **AI Integration**: Test AI services with telephony and CRM components
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Test API endpoints and data flow

### 3. System Testing
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Test complete call flows from lead import to reporting
- **Performance Testing**: Test system under expected load (up to 100,000 leads)
- **Security Testing**: Test for vulnerabilities and data protection
- **Compliance Testing**: Test DND registry checks, calling hours, and script validation

### 4. User Acceptance Testing
- **Dashboard Functionality**: Test all dashboard features and visualizations
- **Campaign Management**: Test campaign creation, script generation, and execution
- **Reporting**: Test analytics, report generation, and data exports
- **Administration**: Test user management, role-based access, and system configuration

## Test Cases

### Lead Management
- [ ] Import leads from CSV file
- [ ] Import leads via API
- [ ] Validate lead data (phone numbers, required fields)
- [ ] Check leads against DND registry
- [ ] Segment leads by source, language, and geography

### Campaign Management
- [ ] Create new campaign with goals and parameters
- [ ] Generate compliant call scripts in English and Hindi
- [ ] Schedule campaign execution within allowed calling hours
- [ ] Assign leads to campaigns
- [ ] Monitor campaign progress in real-time

### Outbound Calling
- [ ] Initiate outbound calls via Twilio
- [ ] Deliver scripts using TTS in correct language
- [ ] Capture responses using STT
- [ ] Record calls for quality assurance

### Dashboard and Reporting
- [ ] Display real-time KPIs and metrics
- [ ] Generate interactive charts and visualizations
- [ ] Create geographical heatmaps of lead distribution
- [ ] Generate PDF and CSV reports
- [ ] Schedule automated report delivery

### Compliance and Security
- [ ] Enforce DND registry compliance
