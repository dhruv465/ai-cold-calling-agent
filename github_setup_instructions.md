# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these step-by-step instructions to create a GitHub repository and push the AI Cold Calling Agent codebase.

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Log in to your GitHub account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter repository details:
   - Repository name: `ai-cold-calling-agent` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: "Autonomous AI cold-calling agent with CRM dashboard"
   - Visibility: Choose either Public or Private
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these files)
4. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push the Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show instructions for pushing an existing repository. Follow these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/ai_cold_calling_project

# Add the remote repository URL
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username and REPO_NAME with your repository name
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If your default branch is named "master" instead of "main", use:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

## 3. Authentication

When pushing to GitHub, you'll be prompted for authentication:

- If you have GitHub CLI configured, it may handle authentication automatically
- Otherwise, you'll need to enter your GitHub username and password
- If you have two-factor authentication enabled (recommended), you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your password

### Creating a Personal Access Token (if needed):

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "AI Cold Calling Agent Push"
4. Select scopes: at minimum, check "repo" for full repository access
5. Click "Generate token" and copy the token immediately
6. Use this token as your password when pushing to GitHub

## 4. Verify Repository Setup

After pushing the code:

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. Verify all files and directories are present
3. Check that the README.md is displayed on the repository homepage
4. Ensure sensitive data is not included (check .gitignore effectiveness)

## 5. Repository Management

Once your repository is set up, you can:

- Configure branch protection rules
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Add collaborators if needed
- Configure issue templates and project boards

## Security Reminders

- Never commit sensitive data like API keys or passwords
- Verify the .gitignore file is properly excluding sensitive files
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Regularly audit repository access and permissions
