- **Campaign Analytics**: Tracks performance metrics for campaigns

### 3. Telephony Integration Layer

- **Twilio Connector**: API integration with Twilio for call handling
- **Call Queue Manager**: Manages outbound call queuing and prioritization
- **Call Recording Service**: Records calls for quality and compliance
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Handles failed calls and retry logic

### 4. AI Conversation Engine

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Service**: Converts scripts to natural speech
- **Speech-to-Text (STT) Service**: Captures and transcribes customer responses
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Analyzes intent and sentiment
- **Conversation Flow Manager**: Handles dialogue trees and decision points
- **Knowledge Base**: Stores information for handling objections and questions

### 5. Data Processing and Analytics

- **Call Logger**: Records detailed call information
- **Analytics Engine**: Processes raw data into actionable insights
- **Reporting Service**: Generates standard and custom reports
- **Machine Learning Module**: Improves conversation handling over time

### 6. CRM Dashboard

- **User Interface**: React-based responsive dashboard
- **Authentication System**: Role-based access control
- **Real-time Metrics Display**: Shows KPIs and performance data
- **Visualization Tools**: Charts, graphs, and heatmaps
- **Export Functionality**: Generates reports in various formats

### 7. Notification System

- **Alert Manager**: Sends notifications based on predefined triggers
- **Email/SMS Gateway**: Sends follow-up messages to leads
- **Callback Scheduler**: Manages scheduled callbacks

## Database Schema (High-Level)

- **Users**: Admin, managers, agents
- **Leads**: Contact information, source, status, history
- **Campaigns**: Goals, scripts, timeframes, target demographics
- **Calls**: Timestamps, duration, outcomes, recordings
- **Conversations**: Transcripts, intent analysis, sentiment scores
- **Reports**: Saved reports and analytics
- **Notifications**: Alert configurations and history

## AWS Infrastructure

- **Compute**: EC2 instances or ECS/Fargate for containerized services
- **Database**: RDS for SQL database
- **Storage**: S3 for call recordings and exports
- **Caching**: ElastiCache for performance optimization
- **API Gateway**: For external integrations
- **Lambda**: For serverless processing of specific tasks
- **CloudWatch**: For monitoring and alerts
- **IAM**: For security and access control

## Security and Compliance

- **Data Encryption**: At rest and in transit
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking
- **Compliance Checks**: Automated verification of regulatory requirements
- **Data Retention**: Policies aligned with Indian regulations
- **Privacy Controls**: Consent management and data protection

## Integration Points

- **External APIs**: Twilio, DND registry, other services
- **Export/Import**: CSV, PDF for data exchange
- **Webhooks**: For real-time notifications and events
- **Authentication**: OAuth/JWT for secure access

## Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more instances during peak times
- **Database Sharding**: For handling large volumes of lead data
- **Caching Strategy**: To reduce database load
- **Queue Management**: For handling high call volumes
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution of traffic across services

## Resilience and Fault Tolerance

- **Service Redundancy**: Multiple instances across availability zones
- **Graceful Degradation**: Core functionality preserved during partial outages
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular database backups
- **Disaster Recovery**: Procedures for system restoration
- **Circuit Breakers**: Preventing cascade failures

This architecture is designed to be modular, allowing for independent scaling of components based on demand and future expansion of features.
